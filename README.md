# shaftpower
Tested and evaluated various machine learning models for predicting shaft power, comparing their performance against a baseline model to identify the most accurate and efficient solution.
The data_prep.py is preparing the initial dataset so it can be used in the training and evaluation phases from several ML models. Every ML method is connected with a function python file (xgboost.py) and a python file that creates the boxplots for model evaluation (xgboost_boxplots.py).
